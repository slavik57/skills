# bookshelf-cascade-delete

This [Bookshelf.js](https://github.com/tgriesser/bookshelf) plugin provides cascade delete with a simple configuration on your models.

## Status

[![npm version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![build status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![coverage status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url]

## Installation

Install the package via `npm`:

```sh
$ npm install --save bookshelf-cascade-delete
```

## Usage

Require and register the `bookshelf-cascade-delete` plugin:

```js
var bookshelf = require('bookshelf')(knex);
var cascadeDelete = require('bookshelf-cascade-delete');

// You need to access the `default` property since the plugin is transpilled from es6 modules syntax.
bookshelf.plugin(cascadeDelete.default);
```

Define which relations depend on your model when it's destroyed with the `dependents` prototype property:

```js
var Post = bookshelf.Model.extend({
  tableName: 'Post'
});

var Author = bookshelf.Model.extend({
  tableName: 'Author',
  posts: function() {
    return this.hasMany(Post);
  }
}, {
  dependents: ['posts']
});
```

**NOTE:** This plugin extends the `destroy` method of Bookshelf's `Model`, so if you are extending or overriding it on your models make sure to call its prototype after your work is done:

```js
var Author = bookshelf.Model.extend({
  tableName: 'Author',
  posts: function() {
    return this.hasMany(Post);
  },
  destroy: function() {
    // Do some stuff.
    sendDeleteAccountEmail(this);

    // Call the destroy prototype method.
    bookshelf.Model.prototype.destroy.apply(this, arguments);
  }
}, {
  dependents: ['posts']
});
```
